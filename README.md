## ⚠️ Disclaimer

**Educational Purpose Only**: This project demonstrates how GitHub contribution graphs can be inaccurate representations of a developer's actual work and productivity.

Contribution patterns can vary significantly due to various factors including:
- **Different workflow preferences** (rebasing, squashing commits, etc.)
- **Private repository work** not visible on public profiles
- **Team collaboration styles** and commit attribution
- **Project timelines and release cycles**
- **Technical constraints** and development environments

When evaluating developers, consider a broader range of indicators such as:
- **Code quality and reviews**
- **Meaningful project contributions**
- **Problem-solving abilities**
- **Collaboration and communication skills**
- **Technical knowledge and growth**

This tool serves as a reminder that contribution graphs, while interesting, don't tell the complete story of a developer's journey or capabilities.

*"The best measure of a developer's worth is not in the green squares they generate, but in the problems they solve and the value they create."* - @appatalks
